I was supposed to learn how to deal with files and lists of lists.
The steps I followed were to make each function seperately and see if they worked 
before integrating them into the main function. My results do match what
I intended to get, as my program works the way it should. The first challenge I encountered
was that I couldn't figure out how to assign shortest to an amount where is could be easily replaced.
I figured out that I could assign it to None so that its there, but anything overrides it.
I first designed the algorithm, then wrote the program, then tested the program to see if it worked.
I think I learned what I was supposed to in this lab, it was difficult working by myself as this
was probably the most challenging and time consuming PA.
